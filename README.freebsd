				*****************


Maintainer: Tijl Coosemans <tijl@ulyssis.org>
Development platform: FreeBSD 4.8-STABLE, XFree86 4.3.0, GTK 2.2.1


REQUIREMENTS
------------

 - A C compiler (gcc, clang)
 - X11 (X Window System)
 - GTK 2.x (http://www.gtk.org/) with libglade
 - the ticonv, ticables2, tifiles2 and ticalcs2 libraries (http://tilp.info/)
 - the libusb library (version 0.1 preferred, there's an experimental support for
   1.0) to use the SilverLink (TI-GRAPH LINK USB) and DirectLink cables


INSTALLATION
------------

The easiest and most recommended way is to use the FreeBSD ports collection.
When you keep your local copy of the ports tree in /usr/ports the
following should fetch, compile and install TiLP and all of its libraries
and clean things up afterwards.

# cd /usr/ports/comms/tilp
# make install distclean

When you want to have support for the Silver Link USB cable, you need to
define WITH_LIBUSB, like this.

# make WITH_LIBUSB=yes install distclean


USAGE
-----

TiLP needs access to some device nodes, which are usually only accessible by
root, so you'll need to run TiLP with super user priviledges. As root, just
enter the command 'tilp'.
