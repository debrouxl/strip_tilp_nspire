This directory contains shortcuts and mime types for KDE integration.
You have to copy:
- tilp.desktop to 
	$HOME/.local/share/applications or /usr/share/applications
- x-tilp-*.desktop to 
	$HOME/.kde/share/mimelnk/application or /usr/share/mimelnk/application

You will have to add a reference to skinedit.desktop into the menu:
- edit $HOME/.config/menus/applications-kmenuedit.menu
- add an entry like '<Filename>tilp.desktop</Filename>'
