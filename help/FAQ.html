<h1 align="center">FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)</h1>
<h2>Windows specific</h2>
<p><b>Q</b>: I am getting font/glyph-related messages such as the following:
<pre>** WARNING **: Couldn't load font "MS Sans Serif 8" falling back to "Sans 8"</pre>
<pre>** ERROR **: file shape.c line 75: assertion failed: (glyphs-&gt;num_glyphs &gt; 0)</pre>
What to do ?<br><br>
<b>A</b>: the fix is to open your <code>C:\Program Files\Shared Files\Gtk\2.0\etc\gtk-2.0\gtkrc</code> and to add the following lines:</p>
<pre>
{
font_name="Arial"
}
widget_class "*" style "user-font"</pre>
This forces GTK+ to use a compatible font (Arial) and reportedly fixes both the aforementioned problems, and probably others too...

<p><b>Q</b>: When I try to run the program, an error message appears on the screen saying it could not locate a dll file or that entry point is missing.<br>
<b>A</b>: Be sure you installed the right GTK+ libaries. If unsure, uninstall them. Next, install TiLP again and request to download library when installers prompts for it.</p>

<h2>Linux specific</h2>
<br><b>Q</b>:
<pre>Hi,
I'm using tilp2-1.00 on gentoo linux.
xeelvr / # tilp2
ticables-INFO: Check for parport usability:
ticables-INFO: node /dev/parport0: exists
ticables-INFO: permissions/user/group: -rw-rw---- root root
ticables-INFO: is user can r/w on device: yes
ticables-INFO: is useable: no
tilp-INFO: Msg: illegal operation or argument.
Cause: the program which uses this library is buggy. Fire-up the developer!
System: Inappropriate ioctl for device (errno = 25)
tilp-INFO: tilp_device_err catched error 51
Do you have any idea ?
</pre>
<br>
<b>A</b>: check that your kernel has support for parport and ppdev. Your linux kernel .config file must contains at least:
<pre>CONFIG_PARPORT=y
CONFIG_PARPORT_PC=
CONFIG_PPDEV=y></pre>
That's all !<br>
