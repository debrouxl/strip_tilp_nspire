These icons has been drawn by Jesse Palmer <jp@jp3d.net>.

Group of icons:
- application, certificate, OS upgrade: pink color
- backup, group: yellow color
- others: blue color

Practically, you just have to change colors of Backup & Zipped icons.
Others are ok.
You TIicon?.ico icons was useful, too.
