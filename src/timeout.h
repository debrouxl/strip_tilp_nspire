/*
  Some explanations about this unit: I use different functions for measuring
  time depending on the platform type.
  In fact, it appears that the Win32 clock() function of <time.h> is 600 times 
  slower than the Win32 GetTickCount() function of <windows.h>. 
  As a consequency of this fact, the speed rate was divided by 4.

  A great thanks to Timothy Singer <tsinger@uoregon.gladstone.edu>, the
  FastLink's developer. He sent to me her routines so that I can compare with
  mine. This allowed me to find why my routines was so slow !
